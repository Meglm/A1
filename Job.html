            My current skills and qualifications related to this position I would say are at the start of possibly a
            10–20-year journey of professional education, development, and experience. The current road I can envision
            to obtain what is required of me can be broken down into four main components:
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Complete the RMIT Bachelor of IT degree to the best of my capability, with the goal of a distinction.
            </li>
            <li>Complete an Honours year at the end of the bachelor’s degree or go for a master’s degree in a
                specialization of IT
            </li>
            <li>Work in the industry as a graduate software engineer to gain industry experience and continue to work in
                this position, or similar, for multiple years.
            </li>
            <li>Complete a Ph.D. whilst I am working in a relevant field.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="generalContent">
            Once I’ve completed all of these, I believe I’ll be able to meet the minimum requirements to apply for a
            position
            as a Machine Learning Researcher with Lockheed Martin Australia or with another cooperation that will
            inevitably
            emerge by the time I am ready for this, as meeting the highest degree of attractiveness for the desirable
            knowledge
            aspects will require enormous amounts of work experience.
