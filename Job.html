            <h2 class="headingTitle">Progression Plan</h2>
            <p class="generalContent">
                My current skills and qualifications related to this position I would say are at the start of possibly a 10–20-year journey of professional education, development, and experience. The current road I can envision to obtain what is required of me can be broken down into four main steps:<br>
                •	Complete the RMIT Bachelor of IT degree to the best of my capability, hopefully with a distinction.<br>
                •	Complete an Honours year at the end of the bachelor’s degree or go for a master’s degree in a specialized field of IT<br>
                •	Begin working in the industry as a graduate software engineer to gain industry experience and continue to work in this position, or similar, for multiple years<br>
                •	Complete a PhD whilst I am working in a relevant field.<br>
                Once all these are met, I believe I will meet the minimum requirements to apply for a position as a Machine Learning Researcher with Lockheed Martin Australia or another industry that surely will have appeared by the time I am ready for this, as to meet the highest degree of desirability for the desirable knowledge aspects will have to be achieved through work experience
