        <p class="generalContent">
            The project I’ve chosen to create is an indoor planter shelf with an IoT (Internet of Things) application
            that can rotate in a 180° horizontal position from a wall to in front of a window by revolving around a
            pole axis positioned on the window frame. This is a long-term solution for indoor plant aficionados who
            want to use natural light instead of artificial light. It’s especially suited for individuals who don’t
            have access to accessible sunlight floorspace in their house and can’t afford the luxury of terra gardens,
            indoor propagation stations or hydroponic tents. In addition, the PhotosyntherSeeker serves for aesthetic
            purposes by adding colour and liveliness to a room by having plants scattered nicely about it for exhibition.
            A water soil monitor will be provided as an optional attachment to increase plant monitoring and may be
            effortlessly integrated into the infrastructure.

        <h2 class="headingTitle">Motivation</h2>
        <div class="generalContent" style="display: inline-block; width: 70%;">
            My motivation for this project was to extend the innovation outlaid by Etsy home décor woodwork creator
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DMDesignWorks/">DM Design Works</a> in the development of a
            <a href="https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/1065371675/swivel-industrial-pipe-shelf-for-window?click_key=f43d234498f6183f1dc2d2c9db4e72d63a50d4c0%3A1065371675&click_sum=c1d1143a&ref=shop_home_feat_1&bes=1">rotatable shelf</a>.
            As the rise of plant enthusiasts spurred by the Covid 19 epidemic continues to develop, I can envision their design being integrated into the IoT in any
            wireless household with a passion for botany, as many live in small houses or apartments where this
            enthusiasm may be stalled by floor space availability. Another important motivator stems from personal
            experience living in a home with inadequate natural interior illumination and primary living area windows
            and doors face the incorrect position in accordance with the sun’s rotation.

        <h2 class="headingTitle">Description</h2>
        <p class="generalContent">
            PhotosyntherSeeker is a smart, attractive, and completely wireless solution for plant lovers who wish to
            make the most of their home’s natural light resources. This rotatable shelf has a number of functions that
            will benefit both users and their plants.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subHeadingTitle">180° Rotation</h3>
        <p class="generalContent">
            The PhotosyntherSeeker 180* rotation allows a user to have their plants on full show in the sun during
            the day, then move them against the wall at night with the push of a button, so they may have both privacy
            in the house with shutters or curtains while still seeing their lovely plant display.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subHeadingTitle">Shelving Options</h3>
        <p class="generalContent">
            The shelves will be 3D printed out of recycles materials, providing a sustainable and lightweight design
            and may be installed in any home, with a variety of lengths and heights to fit most conventional window
            sizes. The regular shelf package comes with two standard shelves in a choice of colours, as well as the
            option to add more for taller windows (4 maximum).
        </p>
        <h3 class="subHeadingTitle">Remote Controllable</h3>
        <p class="generalContent">
            The PhotosyntherSeeker will be controlled remotely using a free mobile phone or tablet application for
            Android and iOS devices. This involves manually controlling rotation with a button tap, as well as arranging
            rotation using the application for a specific time of day or length of time. It can also be schedulable
            for the shelf to rotate out and back in response to the sun’s output, with the utilization of UV sensors.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subHeadingTitle">Application and Diagnostic Data</h3>
        <p class="generalContent">
            The application has a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to control and set timers for
            the shelf, as well as generate reports based on the data acquired by the UV sensors. This includes daily UV
            exposure, key exposure peaks during the day, and longer statistical analyses such as monthly and seasonal
            exposure habits to improve the health and quality of the indoor plants and guarantee their demands are satisfied.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subHeadingTitle">Additional Features</h3>
        <p class="generalContent">
            An additional expansion to the shelf is a moisture detector to supplement the plant’s monitoring systems
            with PhotosyntherSeeker, which can help users understand if their plants are getting enough water to satisfy
            their needs. It will be simply set in the soil of the planter pot, connected to the Arduino, and the
            PhotosyntherSeeker application will identify it and monitor the soil water levels periodically with
            user-friendly reports and notifications through the application, as well as the ability to specify the
            plants’ variety type in relation to each water sensor, to correctly monitor the plant’s individual needs.

        <h2 class="headingTitle">Skills Required</h2>
        <p class="generalContent">
            To be able to successfully create this project multiple skills are required. Firstly, to develop the
            working electronic shelf; a degree of mechanical thinking and an understanding of Arduino technologies is
            necessary. This involves basic understanding of electronics and circuitry, having experience with soldering,
            the ability to program in C++ and use of libraries to work with the various components used in the Arduino
            physical architecture, such as the Wi-Fi module. Secondly having the skills to program in multiple
            different frameworks is key to advancing this project to the next level and integrating with a household’s
            IoT, by designing and building an attractive cross-platform mobile application to interact with the shelf
            wirelessly, while having a functional database to store data collected by the sensors and produce reports.
            Within my current capabilities I have a basic understanding in the skills required and have most of the
            physical components readily available, which is what partially inspired the project. If I were to fully
            commit myself to this project it would be a slow process full of learning, but I believe I could successfully
            execute it.

        <h2 class="headingTitle">Outcome</h2>
        <p class="generalContent">
            On the successful development of this technology, it will open the door for many plant enthusiasts to
            enjoy their hobby seamlessly and sustainably, as well as invite more people into the hoppy because access
            to floorspace or shelving indoors will no longer be an obstacle. Indoor plant life provides scientifically
            proven benefits such as improving air quality, boosting mental wellbeing, aiding in allergy relief, and
            moistening the air. These advantages should be available to everyone, and PhotosyntherSeeker idea strives
            to provide this opportunity.
