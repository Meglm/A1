        <h2 class="headingTitle">What is my interest in IT</h2>
        <p class="generalContent">
            I remember growing up and having the TV blaring first-thing every morning watching <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/rage">RAGE</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugrats">Rugrats</a>, or the family recordings on VHS, and I just
            couldn’t take my eyes from it. I wanted to understand how it was possible to show me these pictures using
            the red, green, and blue ‘squares’ that I would intently watch flicker from 1cm away. This curiosity led
            me to rummage through our tapes and rip them apart, holding the film up to the light and studying each frame
            with wonder before getting into severe trouble for ruining them, teaching me the valuable lesson of re-winding
            tapes in the process. As I have grown, this curiosity has never settled and further molded itself into a
            desperate want to work with technologies and understand more about each aspect, including diving back into
            the origins of technology progression to understand where we are today.<br><br>My passion helped guide me
            towards my studies at TAFE and to my current profession as a Technical Support Officer for a few schools
            in my region. The position has helped me gain a vast knowledge of managing, maintaining, and repairing a
            medium-sized business’s networking and physical technical infrastructure, but I still seek to gain more
            knowledge of all other fields pertaining to the IT industry.

        <h2 class="headingTitle">Why I choose to come to RMIT</h2>
        <p class="generalContent">
            I always wanted to further my studies in IT as my excitement to know more has frequently been nagging at me
            since I finished my TAFE certification, but I didn’t want to have to leave Albany, with education facilities
            and study options limited in this region. I began researching possible careers I could progress to with the
            experience of my current position and level of education but promptly discovered certain university degrees
            were preferable or a certain amount of experience within the specified industry. If I was going to study for
            a degree, it needed to have a wide scope involving many information technology and computer science concepts
            as I wish to gain knowledge of all its compositions before settling on a specialized position. This led to
            the search for online course options that related to the positions found whilst job-seeking and discovered
            the RMIT online courses, specifically the Bachelor of IT.

        <h2 class="headingTitle">What do I expect to learn during my studies</h2>
        <p class="generalContent">
            During my studies at RMIT for the Bachelor of IT, I anticipate gaining a deeper understanding of all IT sector
            terminologies and subjects, including advancing my ability in programming, networking, communications, and more.
            My technical, mechanical, and critical thinking skills are also expected to increase as a result of these
            studies and they will not only be skills used for the advancement of a career, but they will also be lifelong
            skills to develop me as a well-rounded, educated person and improve the quality of my life. Finally, whilst
            continuing through these studies I hope to gain a better understanding of or ‘home in on’ a specific subject
            that I would like to specialize in for my future career path.
