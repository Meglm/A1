            <h2 class="headingTitle">What is my interest in IT</h2>
            <p class="generalContent">
                I remember growing up and having the TV blaring every morning watching RAGE  or Rugrats , or even family recordings on VHS, and I just couldn’t take my eyes from it.
                I wanted to understand how it was possible to show me these pictures and sounds. I would go through our tapes in secret and rip them apart, hold the film up to the light and study each frame with wonder and curiosity before getting in severe trouble for ruining them.
                As I have grown, this curiosity has never seemed to settle and further molded itself into a desperate want to work with technologies and understand more about the field, including diving back into the origins of technology progression to get to where we are today.
                My beginnings in the IT industry involve becoming a Technical Support Officer for a few schools in my region. This position has helped me gain a vast knowledge of managing, maintaining, and repairing a business’s networking and physical technical infrastructure, but I still seek to gain more knowledge outside of this field.

            <h2 class="headingTitle">Why I choose to come to RMIT</h2>
            <p class="generalContent">
                I always wanted to further my studies in IT as my passion to know more has continuously been nagging at me since I finished my TAFE certification, but I didn’t want to have to leave Albany, as education facilities and study options are limited in this city.
                I began researching possible careers I could progress to with the experience of my current position and level of education but discovered certain university degrees were preferable or a certain amount of experience in the industry position posted.
                If I was going to study for a degree, it needed to have a wide scope of the IT industry as I am curious about learning all components before settling on a specialized position. This led to the search for online course options that related to the positions found whilst job-seeking and discovered the RMIT online courses.

            <h2 class="headingTitle">What do I expect to learn during my studies</h2>
            <p class="generalContent">
                During my studies at RMIT for the Bachelor of IT, I expect to gain a better understanding of all the definitions and topics related to the IT industry, including advancing my ability in programming, networking, communications, and more.
                Skills I also expect will be improved during said studies are my technical, mechanical, and critical thinking. These will not only be skills used for the advancement of a career, but they will also be lifelong skills to develop me as a well-rounded, educated person and increase my life’s quality.
                As I continue my studies, I also hope to gain a better understanding of or ‘home in on’ a specific subject that I would like to specialize in for my future career path.
