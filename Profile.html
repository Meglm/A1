        <h3 class="subHeadingTitle">Myers Briggs Type Indicator Test</h3>
        <p class="generalContent">
            This assessment helped me to better understand my own personality, and how it is reflected both positively
            and negatively, as well as gain insight into my personality type through the reports and community of others
            who were placed on the same scale. It also gives me a sense of self-assurance in self that my personality type
            is similar to that of previous great leaders the world has seen, and that some of my internal thoughts about
            myself are represented as a personality attribute rather than a flaw or issue.

        <h3 class="subHeadingTitle">Learning Style Online Assesment</h3>
        <p class="generalContent">
            Understanding my learning style has always been helpful in maximising my learning capacity in every setting
            and this online assessment confirmed my understanding of my distinct learning approaches, but it was also a
            good reminder of what I should focus on throughout my RMIT studies. Being a visual learner combined with online
            learning will have both benefits and drawbacks. While visual content is constantly shared to keep lectures
            and discussions engaging and informative, and any steps performed on a computer can be easily shared, visualizing
            the human element will become more difficult in the future as topics shift from theory to practice.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subHeadingTitle">IQ Test</h3>
        <p class="generalContent">
            Taking this assessment revealed where my IQ stood in comparison to the human average, and it was encouraging
            to see my problem-solving skills were strong, increasing my self-esteem and morale. But, knowing my score,
            I won’t take it too personally because I don’t want to stifle my will to overcome obstacles, pursue new possibilities,
            or improve myself. I do see, though, that having better problem-solving skills is beneficial to the IT industry
            since it is constantly evolving and expanding, with new challenges to solve around every corner, thus the assessment
            has provided me with more confidence in my pursuit of a career within IT.

        <h2 class="headingTitle">How I think these results will influence my behavior in a team</h2>
        <p class="generalContent">
            Based on my findings, I believe I can contribute some valuable traits to a team. My attitude or behaviours
            will not alter significantly as a result of hearing these results, but I will be more conscious of my abilities.
            I'll try to emphasize those qualities that will benefit the team and project the most, such as being able
            to use my diplomatic skills to help the group harmonize individual ideas and create a cooperative, supportive,
            and productive environment in which each person can thrive, or using my strong problem-solving skills to help
            the team overcome any obstacles.

        <h2 class="headingTitle">How I will take this into account when forming a team</h2>
        <p class="generalContent">
            These findings serve as more of a guide than a rulebook in influencing my decision to join a team, whilst
            they may be partially accurate, they cannot specifically validate or capture who I am as complete, intelligent
            being because they are based on a broad average and each person has their own unique characteristics that
            come into play. They do however give me an idea of what traits I might have and allow me to openly debate
            those attributes with others before forming a team. Before building a team, it is vital to be able to openly
            share our learning styles, personality types, and other test findings, as diversity fosters creativity.
