                Hello and welcome to my profile. My name is Meg, and I would like to share a bit about myself.<br><br>
                I was born in Albany, Western Australia, and have remained here most of my life. It’s a small city surrounded by beautiful coastal destinations and hiking trails which I take advantage of in my free time. My education was also completed in Albany, including my K-12 years, to my TAFE studies in Information Technology up to a Certificate IV, attained in 2020.
                During my TAFE studies, I was also fortunate enough to be awarded the Apex Club of Albany’s Great Southern vocational student of the year 2020 and the Southern Regional TAFE’s student of the year across 11 campuses in my region. For my efforts in my studies, I was also a part of the 2021 WA Training Awards and was awarded as a finalist in the Vocational Education and Training category.<br><br>
                Other hobbies I enjoy are growing and cultivating plant life, specifically carnivorous plant species as the way they developed to get their nutrients instead of soil is both spine-tingling and fascinating. Currently, I only have pitcher plants and cape dew but one day hope to grow a plant as magnificent and terrifying as the Pods in Jumanji.
