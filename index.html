            Hello and welcome to my profile. My name is Meg, and I would like to share a bit about myself.<br><br>
            I was born in Albany, Western Australia, and have remained here most of my life. It’s a small city, population 38,370,
            that has deep roots within the ANZAC history and is surrounded by beautiful coastal destinations, tourist attractions,
            and hiking trails which I enjoy taking advantage of in my free time. My education was also completed in Albany, including
            my K-12 years, then my TAFE studies in Information Technology up to a Certificate IV, attained in 2020.<br><br>

            During my TAFE studies, I was fortunate enough to be awarded the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/altruisticservice/">Apex Club of Albany’s</a>
            Great Southern vocational student of the year 2020 and shared the honour of being awarded <a href="https://www.southregionaltafe.wa.edu.au/">Southern Regional TAFE </a>
            2020 <a href="https://www.albanyadvertiser.com.au/news/albany-advertiser/technology-whiz-meg-maroni-named-tafe-student-of-the-year-ng-b881893395z"> student of the year</a>
            across the 12 campuses in my region. In recognition of my academic efforts, I was encouraged to take part in the 2021
            <a href="https://www.dtwd.wa.gov.au/watrainingawards/">WA Training Awards</a> and was awarded as a
            <a href="https://www.jobsandskills.wa.gov.au/news/wa-training-awards-2021-finalists-announced">finalist</a>
            in the Vocational Education and Training category.<br><br>

            One of my main hobbies is growing and cultivating plant life, specifically carnivorous plant species. The way they have
            evolved to get their nutrients through food instead of soil, and the intelligence they seem to have developed when it comes
            to catching their prey is both spine-tingling and fascinating. An example that’s particularly interesting to me is the Venus
            flytrap’s ability to ‘count’, noting how many times its fine hairs have been stroked to determine if what’s been caught
            is worth digesting. Currently, I only have pitcher plants and cape dew for pesky fruit flies, but one day hope to grow a
            plant as magnificent and terrifying as the <a href="https://jumanji.fandom.com/wiki/Pod">Pods</a> featured in Jumanji.
